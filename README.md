# MAL Compare
MAL Compare is a basic script to pull multiple users' anime lists from https://myanimelist.net and produce a self-contained HTML file with a table allowing easy comparison of how different users scored a particular anime.

I wrote this script in 2023, and since it met my own needs, I lost motivation to continue working on it even though much can be improved. I went back and annotated the script with comments and am releasing it to the public so anyone with more motivation can improve it. Neither I nor this program are associated with MyAnimeList in any way.

Detailed instructions for how to use this script are located as comments in the script itself. Have fun!
